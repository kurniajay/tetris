# Project: Cloud-Native Deployment Pipeline Demo  
## Using Azure DevOps, Docker & AKS  
*Internship Project ‚Äì Centre of Excellence, Women in Cloud (RVCE)*

---

## üß© Project Overview  
This project full **CI/CD pipeline** using **Azure DevOps, Docker and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. The goal is to demonstrate how a simple application can be containerized, automated through build/test pipelines, and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster in Azure.

---

## üéØ Objectives  
- Containerize a application with Docker.  
- Configure a YAML pipeline in Azure DevOps that builds, tests, and pushes the image.  
- Deploy the Docker image to AKS using a Kubernetes manifest.  
- Illustrate how CI/CD practices speed up cloud application delivery.  
- Align with internship themes: Cloud computing, DevOps, automation, and scalable deployment.
